### **Full Description**

**Transform your Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu game with Apex BJJ!**

Stop feeling stuck in bad positions. Our AI-powered app creates personalized 4-week missions to systematically improve your defensive game, one position at a time.

**🥋 HOW IT WORKS**

**1. Choose Your Mission**
Tell us what position gives you trouble (side control, mount, back, etc.). We'll create a custom 4-week learning plan with weekly goals.

**2. Set Your Focus**
Before each training session, review your current goal and prime your mind for learning.

**3. Log Your Training**
After class, quickly log your escape attempts using voice recording or quick tap logging (takes 30 seconds!). Our AI extracts the key data automatically.

**4. Get Weekly Feedback**
Every week, our AI analyzes your patterns, identifies recurring problems, and suggests specific fixes with video resources from world-class coaches like Lachlan Giles, John Danaher, and Gordon Ryan.

**📈 TRACK YOUR PROGRESS**

- **Escape Rate Over Time** - See your improvement week by week
- **Training Calendar** - Visual heatmap of your consistency
- **Problem Pattern Analysis** - Discover what's holding you back
