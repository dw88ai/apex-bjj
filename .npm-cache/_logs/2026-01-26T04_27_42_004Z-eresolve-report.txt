# npm resolution error report

While resolving: apexbjj@1.0.0
Found: react@19.1.0
node_modules/react
  react@"19.1.0" from the root project

Could not resolve dependency:
peer react@"^18.0.0" from react-native-web@0.19.13
node_modules/react-native-web
  react-native-web@"~0.19.13" from the root project

Fix the upstream dependency conflict, or retry
this command with --force or --legacy-peer-deps
to accept an incorrect (and potentially broken) dependency resolution.
